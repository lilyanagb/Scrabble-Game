# Scrabble
Scrabble is a word game in which you have to invent words based on those already placed in the dictionary. 
The game consists of 10 rounds.
In each round, 10 letters are generated.
Every word entered by the user is searched in this dictionary whether it is valid or not.
When entering a valid word, its points are calculated (each letter is 1 point) 
and added to the common points of the user.
If a word cannot be written, the player can make 3 changes of letters.
